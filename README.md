# lex-robot

Effect-typed, capability-bounded, auditable control layer for robots — sitting
**above** [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot). LeRobot stays the
ML + hardware engine; `lex-robot` is the safety envelope and the
"judgment vs. authority" boundary (the [lex-os](https://github.com/alpibrusl/lex-os)
thesis, applied to a physical body).

> **Status: design-stage scaffold.** The Lex side compiles and the grant gate
> works; the Python LeRobot sidecar is a build target (see `SIDECAR.md`).
> **Not safe near a real arm yet** — see DESIGN.md §8.

## Layout

```
DESIGN.md        full design note (layering, reuse, milestones, constraints)
SIDECAR.md       the Python sidecar HTTP protocol
lex.toml         package manifest (std-only for now)
src/
  types.lex      Pose, JointState, Frame, Outcome, Grant, Robot
  grant.lex      pure capability checks (workspace, force/velocity clamps)
  client.lex     HTTP bridge to the LeRobot sidecar (localhost)
  skills.lex     bounded skill API (move_to, grasp, run_policy, …)
examples/
  demo.lex       grant gate in action (Denied vs. allowed)
```

## Try the grant gate (no robot needed)

```bash
LEX=/path/to/lex
$LEX check src/skills.lex
$LEX run --allow-effects net,io examples/demo.lex run
# move_to in-bounds   → stalled: ... Connection refused   (allowed → tried sidecar)
# move_to out-bounds  → denied: target outside granted workspace   (blocked, never sent)
# grasp(99N→clamped)  → ...   (allowed; force clamped to the grant ceiling)
```

## How it fits the ecosystem
- **lex-os** — runs `lex-robot` as a supervised box; the grant = physical safety
  envelope + budgets; supervisor can kill/reprovision.
- **lex-loom** — task orchestration as an evidence-gated graph:
  Perceive → Plan → Execute → Verify.
- **lex-trail** — hash-chained audit of commands + observations (also training
  provenance for LeRobotDataset episodes).
- **lex-llm** — high-level planner / skill selector.

## Known scaffold gaps (intentional)
- `actuate` / `sense` are **not** first-class Lex effects yet (compiler-defined
  set); skills carry `[net]` and capability is enforced at runtime via `grant.lex`.
  Promoting them to real effects is a lex-lang change (DESIGN.md §4).
- JSON is hand-built/parsed with `std.str` to stay dependency-free; swap to
  `lex-schema/json_value` once deps are wired.
- No lex-trail wiring yet; no WebSocket streaming yet.
